### BONUS

* Make the appropriate adjustments to your script that will allow it to run on every worksheet just by running it once.

* You can do the bonus activity regardless of which 

### Other considerations:

* As you write your code, test using the testing data set. These sheets are smaller and will allow you to test faster.

* Make sure that your script runs successfully on each sheet. The joy of VBA is to automate tedious tasks.


### Raw Data

* The data for both testing and final result can be found on [DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0aq8cqklq7dj5aq/AABF8HNVqdJbdC2tqz8YdKbha?dl=0)
